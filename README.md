# Hackathon Web App, CodeWars or Learning Resource

Welcome to your penultimate hackathon!

For this hackathon you can pick one of the following:

- Build a web app with React
- Make your own CodeWars
- Make a learning resource for a particular topic, in the form of a blog post, video explainer or tutorial

This repo has already been scaffolded with a React app using `create-react-app`. If you're going with one of the other options, feel free to delete all of the React code and complete the CodeWars/learning resource in this repo instead.

## Web App

In your teams, build any React app. We encourage you to explore and experiment with all the things you've been introduced to over the last two weeks, some of which are:

- Deployments
- Authentication
- Authorisation
- UI Libraries
- Storybook
- NextJS
- Gatsby
- Custom Hooks

The main aim is to engineer a React app, so only bring any of the above things in with a light touch; you have less than a day so scale your plan accordingly!

As always, spend a bit of time ideating and planning, and then build your React app.

## CodeWars

1. Write your kata
2. Write your tests

Refer back to the make-your-own-codewars workshop done before the Christmas break for more detailed instructions.

## Learning Resource

Create a learning resource to be shared with everyone for any of the topics we've covered. It can be in the form of a video explainer, blog post or some other type of tutorial.

## Presentations

Close to the end of the day you'll present to each other in small groups, sharing what you've learnt and achieved during the day.
